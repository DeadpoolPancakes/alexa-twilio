# alexa-twilio
A simple lambda function triggered by alexa to send a text using twilio

This function will send whatever is spoken to Alexa to a predetermined number.

All this requires to run is a twilio account ( they do have a free trial which is useful for getting to grips with their api) and and aws account.
It runs on a lambda function using one of the alexa templates to get started.
